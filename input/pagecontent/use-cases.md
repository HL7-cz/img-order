### Summary of Key Differences

| Request Type | Intended For               | Purpose                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Non-Specific | Any facility               | Performing a new examination                     |
| Specific     | A specific facility/doctor | Performing a new examination                     |
| Consultation | A specific facility/doctor | Expert opinion on already performed examinations |

### Non-Specific Imaging Order

This type of request is not addressed to a specific facility or doctor. The patient receives it from their treating physician and then independently finds a radiology facility that performs the required examination and has available capacity. It's typically used for common, readily available examinations where there's no need to direct the patient to a particular location (e.g., a standard chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound).

It offers the patient greater flexibility in choosing the facility and time of the examination. In the future, in connection with electronic requests (e-requests), non-specific requests should allow for monitoring waiting times and easier booking. A potential disadvantage is that the patient has to find a facility themselves, which can be complicated for some individuals.

### Specific Imaging Order

This request is addressed to a specific radiology facility or even a specific doctor at that facility. The treating physician "sends" the patient to a particular location. It's often used for specialized examinations requiring specific equipment, the facility's expertise, or if the treating physician has an established collaboration with that particular facility. It's also common when the facility operates on an appointment system.

For the patient, this means a smoother process for the examination, as they don't have to search for a suitable radiology facility themselves. It also simplifies communication between their treating physician and the specific radiology department. However, it's important to consider that the patient will have less flexibility in choosing the location and time for the examination.

### Consultation Imaging Request

A consultation request is not primarily for performing a new imaging examination, but rather for seeking an expert opinion (consultation) from a radiologist on examinations that have already been performed. It's typically used when the treating physician needs a second opinion, clarification of a finding, or wants to discuss further diagnostic or therapeutic steps based on existing images (e.g., re-reading a previously performed CT or MRI, discussing the next steps in a complex case).

It enables a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis, leading to more accurate interpretation of findings and optimized treatment. It requires the patient to have previous imaging documentation available.
