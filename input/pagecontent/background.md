In the field of medical imaging, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) protocol and format are standardly used for data archiving and exchange. This defines, for example, individual imaging modalities and is used for data archiving in the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).

DICOM is linked to the SNOMED-CT clinical terminology system. Other standards and nomenclatures are shared by imaging methods with other patient documentation documents: MKN-10 (national representation of international ICD-10), HL7, LOINC and the like.
